msgid "Keep all pronunciation information"
msgstr ""

msgid "ACE Studio will add pronunciation to all notes. This is a redundant data for most Chinese characters, so by default only modified pronunciation will be kept. When this option is turned on, all pronunciation information will be kept unconditionally, but it may produce a larger file size. When the source file contains non-Chinese singing data, please turn on this option."

msgid "Strength-volume mapping coefficient"
msgstr ""

msgid "Since the strength parameter of ACE Studio has a significant impact on the volume, this option is provided to control the mapping coefficient of the strength envelope. The strength envelope will be multiplied by the value of this option as a whole and then mapped to the volume channel of the intermediate model, and the remaining part will be mapped to the strength channel. This option accepts values in the range of 0~1.0."

msgid "Interval of curve sampling"
msgstr ""

msgid "The unit is tick (the length of a quarter note is 480 ticks). By default, the parameter points in the acep file are stored in a very dense manner. Increasing the sampling interval appropriately will not cause much loss of accuracy, but it can get a smaller file size. Setting to 0 or a negative value means keeping the original sampling interval."

"(1) Normalization method: none means to turn off this option, zscore means to perform Z-Score normalization on the parameter points, and minmax means to Min-Max normalize the parameter points to the [-1.0, 1.0] interval.\n"

msgid "This option is used to set the default breath length when the breath mark is converted to a breath parameter. The actual breath length may be less than the default value due to the small gap between notes; some notes may be shortened due to the insertion of breath marks. Setting to 0 or a negative value means ignoring all breath marks."

The threshold unit is the value of a quarter note, and the default is 1, which means that when the distance between notes exceeds 1 quarter notes (480 ticks), they will be split. If you don't want to split at all, please set this option to 0 or a negative value."
