"This option controls the segmentation strategy during conversion. When the "
"value of this option is negative, no segmentation is performed; when the "
"value of this option is 0, segmentation is performed at the threshold where "
"the interval between all notes reaches the threshold; when the value of this "
"option is positive, the minimum length of each segment can be controlled on "
"the basis of segmentation. Setting a reasonable segmentation strategy can "
"reduce the memory usage during synthesis while maximizing the utilization of "
"performance and improving the synthesis effect."
